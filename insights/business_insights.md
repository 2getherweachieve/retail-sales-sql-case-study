1. Revenue Concentration by Category

Analysis shows that a small number of product categories contribute the majority of total revenue. This indicates that business growth is strongly dependent on the performance of key categories, and these should be prioritized for inventory planning, promotions, and product expansion.

2. Profitability vs Sales Volume

Some high-revenue categories have relatively lower profit margins compared to others. This highlights potential opportunities for cost optimization, supplier renegotiation, or pricing strategy improvements to increase overall profitability.

3. Time-Based Sales Trends

Monthly sales trend analysis reveals noticeable variation across months, suggesting possible seasonality and demand cycles. Identifying peak months can help management plan marketing campaigns, stock levels, and workforce allocation more effectively.

4. Customer Contribution Pattern

The Top 10 customers contribute a disproportionately high share of overall revenue. This suggests the presence of high-value customers, making customer retention strategies, loyalty programs, and personalised offers critical for sustained growth.

5. Purchasing Behaviour by Time of Day

Hour-wise analysis shows that sales activity peaks during specific hours of the day. These time windows can be targeted for promotional campaigns, flash deals, and operational staffing optimisation.

6. Gender-Based Sales Distribution

Sales distribution across genders shows measurable differences in revenue contribution, which can support targeted marketing, personalized campaigns, and product positioning strategies.
